# G-BLOCKCHAIN

This is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Go. It includes a Block struct that represents a single block on the blockchain and a Blockchain struct that represents the entire blockchain.

---
## Getting Started
To use this Go implementation of a blockchain, you will need to have Go installed on your system.

To build and run the code, you can use the following steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using 
```
git clone https://github.com/galadd/g-blockchain.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory using 
```
cd g-blockchain
```

- Run the program using 
```
go run main.go
```

This will create a new blockchain instance with a mining difficulty of 3, add a transactions for Gbolahan and Galad to the blockchain, and then check if the blockchain is valid. Finally, it will print out all the blocks on the blockchain.

You can add new bblocks by transacting with the blockchain, and also get the data of any block id that exists on the blockchain

---
## Customizing the Blockchain
You can modify the code to customize the blockchain to your specific needs, such as changing the mining difficulty or adding additional fields or methods to the Block and Blockchain structs.
